# Notes

## Things to fix

- User validator doesn't take into account default settings (to see if values
  have been changed), profiles, etc.
- Profiles are not implemented.
- Nothing is hooked up.

## For next time

- Do migrations first.
- Then split out the validator.
- Then do the prefs
  - Use proxies, not a get() API.
